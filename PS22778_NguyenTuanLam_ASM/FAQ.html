            <p class="text-white mt-5">Which platforms does the Epic Games Store support?</p>
            <p class="text-secondary">The Epic Games Store currently offers PC and Mac support. You can check platform compatibility for individual titles by referring to the "Specifications" section of any product page.</p>
            <p class="text-white">What are the future plans for the Epic Games Store?</p>
            <p class="text-secondary">You can find upcoming features, developer updates, and major known issues on our Epic Games Store Roadmap on Trello. We’ll also share significant updates with you on our news feed and social media pages such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube.  </p>
            <p class="text-white">Why does the Epic Games Store make exclusivity deals?</p>
            <p class="text-secondary">Exclusives are a part of the growth of many successful platforms for games and for other forms of digital entertainment, such as streaming video and music.Epic works in partnership with developers and publishers to offer games exclusively on the store. In exchange for exclusivity, Epic provides them with financial support for development and marketing, which enables them to build more polished games with significantly less uncertainty for the creators. In addition, creators will earn 88% of all the revenue from their game </p>
            <p class="text-white">What is the Support-A-Creator program? </p>
            <p class="text-secondary">The Support-A-Creator program enables content Creators to earn money from games in the Epic Games Store by using Creator Links and Creator Tags. Learn more about the Support-A-Creator program here.  </p>
            <p class="text-white">What’s this about free games?</p>
            <p class="text-secondary">Epic will be offering a new free game available each week. When you claim a free game, it’s yours to keep - even after the game is no longer available to new customers for free. </p>
            <p class="text-white">I claimed a free game but don’t see it on my account now, why?</p>
            <p class="text-secondary">Once you claim a free game, it’s yours to keep. If you come back later and don’t see it in your account, please check to see if you have multiple accounts. If you created an Epic account using an @gmail.com email address, log in to it directly using your Gmail password; using the Google login button will create a distinct account even if it’s tied to the same @gmail.com email address. And check to see if you have both a console-linked account (logging in via PlayStation, Xbox, or Nintendo account) and a separate Epic account. If you still encounter issues, please contact player support here. </p>
            <p class="text-white">Can I try a game before I buy it?</p>
            <p class="text-secondary">Some publishers occasionally offer demos or free trial periods for certain non-free games from time to time (for example, a Free Weekend trial). During a free trial period, you can download and play a trial version of the game before you decide to purchase, but you can no longer access the game when the trial period ends. </p>
            <p class="text-white">When are products eligible for a refund?</p>
            <p class="text-secondary">Games and products are eligible for refund within 14 days of purchase if they are marked as “refundable” or “self-refundable”. However, you must have less than 2 hours of runtime on record. Products that include virtual currency or other consumables and products or games that are marked as “non-refundable” are not eligible for refund. </p>
            <p class="text-white">How do I make my Epic Games account secure?</p>
            <p class="text-secondary">The Epic account system powers Fortnite, Rocket League, Fall Guys, the Epic Games Store, and Unreal Engine. If you use the same email address and password on Epic as you used on another site which has been compromised, then your account is vulnerable to attack. To secure your Epic account, use a unique password, and enable multi-factor authentication. You can learn more about the measures we take to protect your account and what you can do to stay safe here. </p>
            <p class="text-white">What languages does the Epic Games Store support?</p>
